Now, for the third year in a row, it’s declining, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n„Americans operate under a lot of misconceptions about how superior we are in many facets of our lives and this is not one of them,“ the study’s lead author Steven Woolf told Business Insider. „We may think we have best medical care in world and highest life expectancy … but that’s not the case.“\n\nThis decline can’t be linked to just one ethnicity, gender, or geographic area, either: It originates among an entire age group. People between the ages of 25 and 64 in the US are dying at higher rates, wracked by health problems like opioid addiction, obesity, alcoholic liver disease, and suicide.\n\nDespite having the highest per capita health care spending in the world, Americans are „more likely to die before age 65 than people in other countries,“ Woolf added. „Their children, too, are less likely to live as long.“\n\nWoolf and his co-author Heidi Schoomaker’s new study looked at more than 50 years‘ worth of data on US life expectancy from the US Mortality Database and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s WONDER database.\n\nResults showed that, in the 1970s, the country experienced a rapid and significant jump in life expectancy. But by the 1990s, that increase started to level off.\n\nMedical advances, particularly in the realms of cancer treatment and heart health, prompted an almost 10-year increase in the average American’s lifespan. Between 1959 and 2013, life expectancy rose from 69.9 years to 78.9 years. Now, however, that average has dropped to 78.6 years.\n\nThe news isn’t good if you compare it to other countries, either. In 1960, Americans had the highest life expectancy of any country in the world. But in the past couple of years, the US has plummeted to the bottom of the list of countries with a similar GDP and high average income, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nIn fact, the US is currently ranked in the mid-40s globally in terms of life expectancy, squished between countries like Lebanon, Cuba, and Chile, which have GDPs that fall far short of our own.\n\nThese deaths can’t be traced back to a single cause, either. Woolf’s research revealed that mortality among members of this age group has increased from 35 different causes. However, drug overdose, alcohol abuse, and suicide — referred to by some as „deaths of despair“ — appear to be the primary culprits.\n\nSuicide rates went up by nearly 40% for people between the ages of 25 and 64, and by 56% for people ages 55 to 64 during the same time frame. For Americans between the ages of 25 and 34, the rate of alcohol-related disease deaths spiked almost 160%, as well.\n\nmbulance medics care for a man in his 40\\'s who was found unresponsive after overdosing on an opioid in the Boston suburb of Salem, Massachusetts, on August 9, 2017.\n\n„Working-age Americans are more likely to die in the prime of their lives,“ Woolf said. Between 2010 and 2017, midlife US adults experienced a 6% total increase in mortality rate.\n\nThe largest increases in death rates occurred among people living in New England states (middle-aged New Hampshirites saw a 23.3% uptick; Maine residents, 20.7%; Vermont dwellers, 19.9%) and residents of the Ohio Valley (West Virginians experienced a 23% increase and Ohioans, 21.6%).\n\nNot all parts of the US experienced the same trend, however. Life expectancy between 2010 and 2017 increased for Americans living in Hawaii, California, and parts of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nAll told, men are dying in overall higher numbers than women. However, Woolf’s research reveals that women experienced an greater increased risk of drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related liver disease compared to previous decades.\n\n„There’s an obvious implication of this for employers,“ Woolf said. „If this trend continues, they’re going to have a less healthy, less productive workforce that’s more likely to die prematurely compared to employees in other countries.“\n\nThis counterintuitive trend — of an affluent, first-world country that spends billions on privatized healthcare losing swaths of their middle-aged working class — could be traced back to one massive elephant in the room.\n\n„It’s a quandary of why this is happening when we spend so much on healthcare,“ Woolf said, adding: „But my betting money is on the economy.“\n\nThe „Rust Belt,“ the Midwestern US states nearest to the Great Lakes like Ohio, were among the hardest hit by changes to the economy and related loss of factory jobs, the researcher said. „Steel mills and coal mines have been closing, while in contrast, California has done well in terms of its economics.“\n\nCoal miner Jaden Fredrickson, 26, of Cheat Lake, West Virginia, waits for the arrival of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt who visited the Harvey Mine on April 13, 2017 in Sycamore, Pennsylvania. The Harvey Mine, owned by CNX Coal Resources, is part of the largest underground mining complexes in the United States.\n\nUpticks in suicides, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related diseases „are all symptoms of people struggling in a poor economy who can’t afford housing, find consistent jobs,“ and despair because of it, according to Woolf.\n\n„We are seeing social determinants of health shaping well-being and outcomes,“ Howard Koh, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of public health who was not involved in the study, told Business Insider.\n\nIn countries around the world, research has shown that people with lower incomes die sooner than their wealthier counterparts. A 2017 study linked low socioeconomic status to significant reductions in life expectancy.\n\nBut what makes the US unique, according to Woolf, is that „poor people in other countries live longer than poor people in our country.“\n\nThe gap between America’s rich and poor has widened not only from a socioeconomic standpoint but also in terms of health inequality.\n\nR.J. Taylor Memorial Hospital, Inc. Family Medicine Physician Dr. Albert Warren, MD consults with a patient and records the patient’s symptoms on an electronic tablet in Hawkinsville, Georgia on March 6, 2013.\n\n„The price you pay in terms of your health for not being on the top rung of the economic ladder is getting more dire,“ Woolf said.\n\nAccording to Koh’s editorial commentary on the new study, the difference in life expectancy between America’s top and bottom 1% can be up to 14 years for men and 10 years for women.\n\nThe only way to find out whether Koh’s prediction is true is by analyzing the most recent life expectancy data from 2018. Those numbers will be released by the CDC in the next few months, Woolf said. „But all signs from research we’ve done indicate it’s not going to be good news.“\n\nAnd neither Woolf nor Koh think that the life expectancy situation will improve over time unless the underlying social and socioeconomic issues are adequately addressed. Woolf said state governments need to invest in marginalized communities and work to alleviate financial burdens on middle-class families.\n\nThe Harvard researcher added that US policy-makers need to pay more attention to what he calls „leading causes of life,“ like building stronger communities that precipitate more vibrant social connections and help Americans rebuild a sense of purpose in the face of financial despair.","polarity_confidence":0.681517481803894,"subjectivity_confidence":1
